h1. Example scenarios:

h3. Application startup:
* everything loads
* application.js fires off an event to say everything has loaded
* queueController listens to that event and loads all queue items

h3. If a user wants to pause a queue item:
* user clicks a button, which will be in a view
* button will have a handler which will call a method in queueController.js, for example:
* @pause: function(item) {
    //do stuff
}@
* button would call: @App.controllers.QueueController.pause(item)@
